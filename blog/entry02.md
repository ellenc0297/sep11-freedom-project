### Tool: Kaboom
The main part of the project was to make the sprite accessible to move for the user, during the past months I was about to make progress by how to make my sprite work the way I wanted to be, so I can practice to do it for my project. It will help a lot to make it pretty and helpful for my future freedom project with my group mate and make it look good and smooth.
