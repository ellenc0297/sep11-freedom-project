## Elevator Pitch & Presentation + Context
During this year, I learned and develop a bunch of new skills during my years of learning in **SEP11**. In our year of learning, we learn on how we use our tool for our freedom project, **Kaboom** and my notes from last year from **SEP10** to help me create the menu for our project created with **HTML and CSS** and I learned more from **Javascript, p5js, DOM** to help my partner with the projects we worked on throughout the year. But throughout the year, I learned a lot through my **research** and my **collabration** with my teammate from part B of our game, from the amount of **trails and error and communicate** to rely on each other to make our presentation work and presentable to everyone to enjoy our project, we wanted to make our project work from the amount of **time** we spend on our codes and **paying attenetion to small details** in our codes. 

During this year, my elevator pitch and presentation between my partner and me as been improve a bit, looking back at my past blog I saw that I was nervous and don't know how to talk through the amount of stutter I did and a lot of mistakes that I made during those time due to how I can be nervous sometimes. It could be because I don't know how to put everything together to make a good explaination. But thanks to Mr Mueller and other teachers I learn how to be more confidence on what I need to say to other students to understand. Last year, I also struggle how to speak to my peers, but this year I learned to speak up more and express myself more to other people instead of being stuck there and do nothing. I'm glad I get to learn these stuff during my time in SEP, even through all those challenges that pushed myself to be better and the blog/writeup he give us so I can look back into my past self struggle and understand what I learned and improve from my past action. 

## Engineering Design Process (EDP)
Due to how we finished with everything that we needed for SEP from the SEP Elevator Pitch & Presentation for our Freedom Project, I finally reach ``Step 7: Improve as Needed`` and ``Step 8: Communicate the Results``. Looking back to my past self on how clusmy and easy I was with myself of doing the bare minium of my work and now I put more efforts into my notes and everything so I can understand what I need to do. From my peers feedback, the elevator pitch and from junior years on how I can improve how I speak to other people and how I presented myself to other people. This help me present and be ready in the future for myself if I were to work in an interview to get a job for myself. 

Step 8 was how I was able to make a stronger bonds with my partners from both the Part A and Part B of my project on how we were able to make something from our interested from our hobbies of making games. It was important thing for me because I can continue to use this next year or in the future for me to communicate well with other people and peers to help my future self grow to not be nervous with people. 

Some skills that I’ve learned from working on this blog are **time management**, **collabration** and **Communication**.

#### Time management

I have several commitments outside of school, such as from these examples like tutoring some kids and which I sometimes want to set times for myself, like don't procastinate while doing homework. But my workload at school is becoming busier, so I needed to make more time for myself to relax more. So I decided to go home immediately and start doing my homework, and to get help if neccassary. I think this change will change how I moving forward and how other people will view me. This is still a problem for me because I still have hard time focusing because I sometimes needed help from my peers and friends, but usually I get distracted easily.

#### Collabration

Brainstroming is another important type of skill, that is needed during this process because we all work together to build something that we wanted and help each other out when needed, even through rough time. Speaking up help makes the process faster and better instead of staring into your screen finding that problem that you don't understand

### Communication 
Communication is also another important type of skill to have during SEP. Since I’m working going to work on this project with another person, for me, it’s very important to collaborate and talk to one another. But, at the same time I had a hard time communicate with my peers because we have to stay connected with each other when we have the time to do our codes to stay in track. But, there is time when I struggle a lot with my codes and have to debug them everytime, I have to ask peers and partner for these type of error in my code. Without this part of this skill I would have struggle to finish my Freedom Project 

## Sources
These are the notes that I used to tinker my tools and my menu for our game. These webiste helped me understand and remember what I needed in my project and how it works. I created slides to help us present for our project in class and the elevator pitch. It helped give different takeaway and challenged that I faced during the my year creating this project.
