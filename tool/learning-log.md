[Replit for Kaboom](https://replit.com/@replit/Kaboom#code/main.ts) ---> using this as a reference on how to start my code for Kaboom (basically a quicker/easiest version to start using Kaboom, using this as an example to help me understand the code a bit better. 

After looking at the replit, based on what I can refer to
#### Notes
* "sprite()" - makes an image of the enivornment in 2D, with "bean" sprite we can just loaded in loadSprite()
* "add[()]" - is to add it with
* "pos()" - position with the x and y coordinates
* "area()" - adds a collider to it

``` js
add([
	// list of components
	sprite("bean"),
	pos(80, 40),
	area(),
])
```
#### Explain what I think is happening
I'm slowly learning on how this work, after researching a bit on how those codes work because I can't find place to tinker with this code with since it wont work.
But I think "bean" is the character they are using to demonstrate it, in the game enivorment where he use it to make him move
position is where he starts and the area be how big the place is for "bean" to go

### Goals
* to make sure to find a proper webiste to tinker my codes with, maybe try making an account for replit?
* do a bit more research on the codes ---> there could been more then that, **do more research**
* try not to procastinate too much ---> kept forgetting that I needed to learn my tools
